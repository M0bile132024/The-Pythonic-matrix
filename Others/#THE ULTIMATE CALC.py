#THE ULTIMATE CALC 
#By: @M0bile132022
#Date: 2025-02-1
#Version: 1.53
'''Description: This is a ULTIMATE calculator that can perform ULTIMATE operations such as SA:VOL, 
PHYSIC EQUATIONS, , 
pythagoras therom,
Perimiter/Area,
The basics,
Ordering,
Planetary time and arcs/sectors/chords(included in others(in a future update)),
Standard form and more!
'''#Note: This is a calculator that can do a lot of things, so don't be surprised if you see a lot of code.
